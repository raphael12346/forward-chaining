##****Forward Chaining System Documentation****

#**Overview**

This Python script implements a simple Forward Chaining System with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The system allows users to input facts and rules, perform forward chaining inference, and view the resulting facts.


#**Usage**

Run the script (forward_chaining_gui.py).
Enter facts and rules using the GUI.
Click "Generate Facts" to perform forward chaining.
View the generated facts and new facts in the text area.


#**Note: **

"if A and B, then C" - this format won't work, i have to fix this.
use this format instead,
"A and B, C"
