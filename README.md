## Forward Chaining System Documentation

### Overview

This Python script implements a simple Forward Chaining System with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The system allows users to input facts and rules, perform forward chaining inference, and view the resulting facts.


### Usage

1. Run the script (forward_chaining_gui.py).
2. Enter facts and rules using the GUI.
3. Click "Generate Facts" to perform forward chaining.
4. View the generated facts and new facts in the text area.


### Note: 

"if A and B, then C" - this format won't work, i have to fix this.
use this format instead,
"A and B, C"
